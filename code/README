We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair is
responsible for the work performed by the other partner,
and all work has been reviewed by both partners working
together. Both of us know the format of the PARTNER file.

DESCRIPTION

This program uses templates to implement a circular doubly
linked list that stores key,value pairs read from files or 
standard input.

USAGE

Running 'make' or 'make all' will compile the program. 
Running 'keyvalue <file1> <file2> ...' will execute the program 
with the files provided or if none are given it will read from 
stdin, ending with Ctrl-d.
Running 'make clean' will remove all binaries. 
Running 'make spotless' will remove all binary files and keyvalue.
